# V.O.L.E. : Villains' Odious League of Evil
A quick-playing social deduction game inspired by Clue

3-6 players, ~20 minutes

## Components
* 23 cards: 7 Suspects, 7 Schemes, 9 Locations (print out [vole.pdf](https://github.com/sitnaltax/vole/blob/main/vole.pdf))
* Notebook worksheet (print out [notebook.pdf](https://github.com/sitnaltax/vole/blob/main/notebook.pdf))

You will need to print and assemble the cards. I like to print them out on ordinary paper and put them into an opaque card sleeve with a CCG card backing, but you can also print on cardstock.

Each player needs one Notebook page.

## Objective
A cunning villain from the sinister organization V.O.L.E. (Villains' Odious League of Evil) has executed a plan to steal a priceless cultural treasure, and hidden it in their evil lair! To recover the treasure you must determine which Suspect it was, what Scheme they used, and what Location they have hidden the treasure.

## Setup
1. Sort the cards into Suspects, Schemes, and Locations. (The icons in the bottom right show which is which)
2. For 3 or 6 players, remove 1 Suspect and 1 Scheme, reveal those cards to all players, and set them aside. They will not be used this game. For 4 or 5 players, don't remove anything.
3. Shuffle each category of card separately, then choose one of each and secretly put them aside. **This is the actual Suspect, Scheme, and Location for the crime.**
4. Shuffle all of the remaining cards together into a single deck, and deal out an even number to each player.

## Play
The youngest player goes first. On your turn, you may make a Guess or an Accusation. Usually you will make a Guess. After your turn, play continues clockwise.

### Guess
To make a Guess, you announce a Suspect, Scheme, and Location. Starting with the player to your left, each opponent must "disprove" this guess if possible by privately revealing to you one of the named cards if they are holding it. If they are holding multiple guessed cards, they may reveal any one of their choice. Everyone else can see that a card was revealed but _not_ which one. If they can't, the next player clockwise must disprove the guess, and so on. If no player can disprove the guess, nothing happens.

### Accusation
An Accusation is a do-or-die bet that you know the secret Suspect, Scheme, and Location. To make an Accusation, publicly announce their prediction, then _privately_ check the secret cards. If you are correct, you win the game! If you are incorrect, you are eliminated and cannot make any more guesses, but you continue playing to disprove other players' Guesses.
